Some basic rules for Java:

In general, we follow Android Java style rules.
http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html

1) Use full names for class fields when possible.

2) Use full names for class methods.

3) Local variables can be named using abbriv.

4) Use a leading 'm' for each class field, and use a leading 'g' for
each static class field. Constants start with 'k's.

5) Class definition follows the ordering below:
   fields
   static fields
   constructors
   static methods
   methods

   In each category, always declare the simple functions (e.g.
   getter/setter) later.

6) Avoid using 'this' whenever possible.

7) Use the following format for TODOs:
   // TODO(your name): Content.

8) All comments start with //.

9) Always use full sentences for comments.
   // This is a comment.

10) Don't make a method public unless it's necessary.

11) Avoid vertical space as much as possible.
